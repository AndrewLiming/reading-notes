## Reading Notes Class 9

### Chapter 7: Forms
- `<form>` form controls live inside this element.
- every `<form>` element requires an action attribute
- forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.
- information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
- each form control is given a name and the text the user types in or the values of the options theyselect are sent to the server.

### Chapter 14: Lists, Tables & Forms
- List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties
- table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent
- Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS
- forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.
