# Markdown Notes

Markdown is a lightweight syntax for styling forms of writing on Github

Markdown is mostly just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in.

 `#` is an `<h1>` tag, `##` is an `<h2>` and so on

 `*` is italic, `**` is bold

 `* ` is an unordered list tag

 `1.` is ordered list
 `![]()` is how to tag an image

 `[]()` is how to tag a link

 `>` is blockquotes

 `<>` is inline code
