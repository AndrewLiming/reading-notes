# Class 1 notes

- HTML describes the structure of a page
- it uses html tags to put up the bones of a web page
- `<p>` is an example of an opening tag, `</p>` is an example of a closing tag
- attributes provide additional information about the content of a page
- a page is made up of a body, a head, a title and a footer.
- start each page with `<!DOCTYPE html>` to let the browser know which version of html you are using
- if you want to add a comment to your code, make sure it is between `<!-- and -->` tags
- you can use an id attribute to single it out for maniplation with css
- you can use class attributes to manipulate everything within that class in css
- block elements alwaus appear to start on a new line in the browser window
- inline elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements
- the `<div>` and `<span>` elements allow you to gorup block-level and inline elements together.
- the `<meta>` tag allows you to supply information about your web page
- new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different things on a web page to help give it structure.
- Older browsers need extra javascript to help them understand which elements are block-level
- Wireframes help you plan out how your website is going to look and function. It shows the heirarchy of information.
- It's important to know who you're trying to attract to your page and what information they want.
-  design is about information and visual hierarchy helps visitors take in your information.
- a script is a series of instructions.
- computers approach tasks differently from how we approach them so our instructions must let the computer solve the task programatically.
- Break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete it. that's how you write a script.
- a browser sees a web page by receiving a page as html code, creating a model of the page and storing it in memory and then using a rendering engine to show the page on screen.
- It's best to keep JavaScript in it's own JavaScript file. theyre text files but have the `js.` extension.
- the tag `<script>` is used in html pages to tell the broswer to load the javascript file.
