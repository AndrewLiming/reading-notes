Class 5 Reading

CSS associates style rules with HTML elements. CSS rules govern how the elements should be displayed
CDD rules contain two parts: a selector and a declaration.
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of a property and a value, seperated by a colon.
you can specify several properties in one declaration, each seperated by a semi-colon
CSS rules usually appear in a separate document though the can be within an HTML page as well.

you can specify color in three different ways: RGB values, which express how much red, green and blue are in the color, HEX codes, six digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color preceeded by a #, and Color names, of which there are 147 predefined colors.

You can use Color pickers to help find the color you want.

It is important to make sure that the contrast between your background and your text is varied enough that it ill be easy to read. 

CSS3 has introduced new values such as RGBA, an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity and HSLA, the ability to specify colors as HSL values with an optional opacity value.
