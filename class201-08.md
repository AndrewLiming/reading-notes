## Chapter 15 Layout

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in it's own box. This box will either be ablock level bo or an inline box.
- If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known s the containing or parent element.

- CSS hs the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: Normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning.

- Brecause screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide.
- Fixed width layout designs do not change sizes as the user decreases or increases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in ixels.
- Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages. 
- Grids help you to create professional and flexible designs.
You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
