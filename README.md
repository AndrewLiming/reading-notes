### What is Growth Mindset to me.

- Growth Mindset is remaining teachable. It's about not knowing but being open to learn and grow and absorb new information

### How can i keep myself in a growth mindset?

- Keeping a positive attitude: if discouraged, add a yet to the negative thought
- Believe that abilites and knowledge can be developed through hard work and dedication.
- Ask questions about things you don't understand. Dont stay in the pit longer than 15 minutes.
