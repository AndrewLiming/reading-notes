# Read 6b: Computer Archtiecture

A computer Takes input, stores information, processes the information, and then outputs the results.

The original computers were basically giant calculators.

Input is any sort of data that the computer takes in.

algorithm: a series of commands.

the output depends on what the computer is designed to do.

Binary & Data: 
  1's and 0's.  1 on, 0 off. 

  bit is the smallest piece of information a computer can store.

  the more bits, the more information a computer can store.

Decimal number system 0-9
binary system 0-1
binary systems multiply by 2's
text and pictures are also built with 1's and 0;s,

wave forms for sound are broken down into binary as well

Circuits:
  Input and Output are effectively a type of information represented by 1's and 0's
 computers use circuits to anylyze information to produce output.

 complicated circuits take multiple signals & combine them to give different results.

Memory, CPU, Input & Output
 When you press a key, the keyboard turns it into binary, the cpu calculates how to display it, it requests info from memory, then runs the results and then the screen outputs the results. to display a single key, the computer runs thousands of instructions.

Hardware & Software
  CPU: Master Chip that Controls All The Other Parts Of The Computer.
  It has circuits for math & logic, and citcuits to send & receive information to other parts of the computer

Software tells the CPU what to do. 

Operating System: The Master Program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer.
