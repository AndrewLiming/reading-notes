# 201 Class 2 Reading Notes

- Structural markup: elements that can be used to describe both headings and paragraphs
- Semantic markup: provides extra informationl such as emphasis in a sentence, things written in quotation and so on.
-  `<H1>` through `<h6>` are the levels of heading, `<h1>` being the largest and `<h6> being the smallest.
- to create a paragraph tag, write the text between an opening and closing `<p>` tag.
- `<b>` is to write in bold, `<i>` is for italic.
- `<strong>` is to create strong emphasis, `<em>` is for italics/
- `<blockquote>` creates a blockquote and `<q>` creates quotes

- a CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration. 
- CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and are made up of a property and a value, seperated by a colon. you can us a semi colon to specify several properties in a declaration.
-you can use `<link>` to tell the browser where to find the css page you're using to style your HTML document. 
- you can also include CSS in the HTML page by putting them inside a `<style>` element which is usually in the `<head>` element

- Scripts are a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.
- You should write comments to explain what your code does. Comments help make your code easier to read and understand. This will help you and others who read your code.
- a script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.
- Before you can use a variabe, you need to declare it. 
- Once you have created a variable, you can tell it what information you would like it to store for you. This is called assigning a value to the variable.
- Booleans are data types that can hve one of two values: true or false.
- Arrays are a type of variable that store more than one piece of information.
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and Boolean values.
- There are two components to a decision: an expression is evaluated, which returns a value; a conditional statement says what to do in a given situation.
- `==` is equal to
- `!=` is not equal to
- `===` is strict equal to
- `!==` is strict  not equal to
- `>` is greater than
- `,` is less than
- `>=` is greater than or equal to
- `<=` is less than or equal to.
- In any condition there is usually one operatorand two operands. the operands are placed on each side of the operator. They can be values or variables. You often see expressions enclosed in brackets.
- Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
- `&&` = Logical And
- `||` = logical or.
- `!` = Logical not
- If statements evaluates a condition. If the condition evaluates to true, any statements in the subsequent code block are executed.
- if.. else statements check a condition. If it resolve to true, the first code block is executed. If the condition resolves to false, the second code block is run instead.
