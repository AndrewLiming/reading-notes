# Comparing Operators

Evaluating Conditions
    == equal to: operator compares two values to see if they are the same.
    != not equal to. operator compares two values to see if they are NOT the same.
    === strict equal to. Operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same.
    !== strict not equal to. operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are not the same.
    > greater than. operator checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.
    < Less than. this operator checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right
    >= greater than or equal to. this operator checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right.
    <= less than or equal to. This operator checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right.

Logical Operators. 
    Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
    && Logical and. This operator tests more than one condition
    || This operator tests at least one conditions.
    ! Logical ot. This operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it.

Loops
    Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. There are three common types of loops:
        for: if you need to run acode a specific number of times, use for loop. the condition is usually a counter to tell how many times the loop should run.
        While: if you don't know how many times the code should run, use while for it to run as long as the condition is true.
        Do While: similar to the while, the difference is it will run it at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false.
