## CSS links

- Links allow you to move from one web page to another.
- links are created using the `<a>` elementL for example `<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>`
- Users can click on anything that appears between the opening `<a>` tag and the closing `</a>` and will be taken to the page specified in the href attribute.
- When you are lining to other pages within the same dsite, you don't need to specify the domain name. you can use a shortened bersion known as a relative URL.
- When making a larger website It's a goodf idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each section into a new folder or "directory".
- `mailto` links create links to an email account.
- to create a link to a specific part of your page, use the id attribute `#`

## Chapter 15 Layout

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in it's own box. This box will either be ablock level bo or an inline box.
- If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known s the containing or parent element.

- CSS hs the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: Normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning.

- Brecause screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide.
- Fixed width layout designs do not change sizes as the user decreases or increases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in ixels.
- Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages. 
- Grids help you to create professional and flexible designs.
You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
