##  HTML & Wireframe

- Foundation
- Using Structure provided make it easier
- Worked first time
- validating and awesome
- Wireframe and labels help create the Structure
- Wireframe is a road map of where we are going

<body> - this is where the content going
<!DOCTYPE html> telles the browser what it is reading and to expect HTML
<head> - Title, link css, link js, meta, sizeing data

3 areas in the body: header, main, footer
