Jquery & Javascript notes

 What is a script and how do I create one
    A script is a series of instructions.
    to write a script, you need to state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
     Define the Goal
     Design the Script
     Code Each Step

Expressions and Operators

    an expression evaluates into a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions;
     expressions that just assign a value to a variable or
     expressions that use two or more values to return to a single value

    Expressions rely on things called operators: they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

    you cam use arithmetic operators in javascript

    there is only one string operator  the + symbol

What is a Function?
    Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the funtion (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
