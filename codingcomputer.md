- Today we worked on setting up our computers for coding. As a windows user, I donwloaded Windows Terminal and then Ubuntu. After setting up Ubuntu as the main terminal, I downloaded vscode and a series of extensions for that text editor.  I had a few questions regarding installing Ubuntu so I asked for some help from the teacher.  

- Once all of that was installed, I read "Choosing A Text Editor" by The Older Coder.  It had a lot of information regarding different programs and the difference between Text Editors and IDE's. Basic Text Editors are just that. Basic text editors. While IDE's (integrated Development Editors) are more multi-functional. While basic text editors are basically a whiteboard that you write on with little assistance, IDE's have the ability to debug and compile the code you're writing, in addition to file managing and writing the actual code. 

-It looks like we'll be using vscode, an IDE, in this class. I look forward to getting to work on it.
